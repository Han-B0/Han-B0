## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- I am currently working full time in the medical field. I have always been interested in computer science, but I was too scared to start. October 2024 I finally made the jump by enrolling in college with a major in computer science. I am still very new, know close to nothing about this field, but I am loving all the new information and concepts i'm learning. I am excited with all the possibilities this field has to offer. Always excited to learn new skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning python, html, javascript and CSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. I think I will be a hindrance at this point.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... a direction to go in.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... ðŸ¥‹ jiu jitsu. It's my passion and I constantly consume bjj information. I love the sport and love sharing what I know.
